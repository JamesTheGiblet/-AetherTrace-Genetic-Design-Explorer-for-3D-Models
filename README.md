# -AetherTrace-Genetic-Design-Explorer-for-3D-Models
AetherTrace is a genetic algorithm-driven tool for evolving 3D mesh designs. Users guide evolution through manual selection or functional fitness goals (symmetry, curvature, volume, etc.). Available as a Blender add-on or standalone PyQt6/Gradio app, AetherTrace transforms procedural design into an organic, adaptive process.
